# Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"> I'm Lisa 

## I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer

- I come from the Art & Design industry. 
- My experiences led me to the tech world and my current path in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Software Engineering. 
- I'm highly interested in computer vision, AR/VR/MR, and finding ways to infuse new technologies into projects - which breaks down to long hours of researching, brainstorming, and code testing.

But you know, what would you do if not trying to make your end-user happy ever after! :)
